    <h2 class="about">About This Website</h2>
    <p class="about">This website was originially created for a coding project but the goal of this website is to help better inform people on dogs. I chose to create a website on dogs as I have always wanted to have one as a pet. While creating this website I have gained the opportunity to educate myself on everything I need to know about dogs and I wish to spread the knowledge.</p>
    <h2 class="content"> What You Can Expect From This Website</h2>
    <p class="content">In this website we have a page dedicated to the different types of dog and their needs. We also have other pages dedicated to training and diet. We also have a pet food delivery service, the form to sign up is on the bottom of the dieting page.</p>
